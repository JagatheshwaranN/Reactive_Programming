Schedulers != Parallel-Execution
================================
1. All the operations are always executed in sequential.
2. Data is processed one by one - by a thread from the ThreadPool for a subscriber.
3. Schedulers.parallel() - is a thread pool for CPU tasks. Does NOT mean parallel execution.

Scheduler - ThreadPool
======================
boundedElastic - 10 * Number of CPU - Network / Time-Consuming / Blocking Operations.
parallel - Number of CPU - CPU intensive tasks.
single - 1 - A single dedicated thread for one-off tasks.
immediate - N/A - Current Thread.
